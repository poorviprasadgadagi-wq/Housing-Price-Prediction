# Housing-Price-Prediction
## Project Overview
Using characteristics including location, size, number of rooms, and amenities, the Housing Price Prediction project creates a whole machine learning pipeline to estimate house values. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation are all performed by the pipeline, which generates precise forecasts and pinpoints important variables affecting housing costs. For practical applications and upcoming improvements in predictive housing analytics, this project offers a scalable and predictable approach.
